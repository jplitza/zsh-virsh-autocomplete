zsh_virsh_autocompletion
========================

This is a zsh autocompletion file for the libvirt virsh command

Working for libvirt >= version 0.9 
Tested on libvirt 0.9.12-5 on Debian wheezy

99% work of this is done by Jan-Philipp Litza, so credit goes
to him. I personally like to pay him respect for being able
to survive in this horrific syntax of zsh completing functions.


INSTALLING

TODO: Add a better install hint.

For me it worked out to copy the _virsh file to
/usr/share/zsh/functions/Completion/Zsh and restart the shell.
